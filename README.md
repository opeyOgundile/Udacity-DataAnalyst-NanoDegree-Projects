This is my  Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

Project 1 - Analyse Weather Trends
In this project, I have analysed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends with where I live to overall global temperatures

Project 2 - Investigate data
In this project, I will  be analyzing a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

Project 3 - Analyze A/B Test Analysis
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:
Implement the new webpage,
Keep the old webpage, or
Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

Project 4 - Data Wrangling
TThis project is based on the "WeRateDogs" Twitter page, a page which is used to rate pictures and  videos of dogs. My task here is to go through the wrangling processes: by gathering, accessing, and cleaning data. Create Insights and visualizations. I will be gathering data from three different sources. 
It is also mandatory for me to assess the data manually and programmatically in order to identify some qualities and tidiness issues associated with the datasets

Project 5 - Data Visualization of Bike Sales
This project is on the exploration of dataset containing bike sales.
In this project I wanted to see the variables that brought it more sales for the Bike stores. Also to check if there was an impact of Cost on Revenue. I also considered profit made by different age groups. The main variables considered were Ageof customer, Country of Customer, State of Customer, Gender of Customers, Cost of products, Products, Product Category, Revenue, and Profit.
